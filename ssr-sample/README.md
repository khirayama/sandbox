## Stacks

- App
  - [x] express
  - [x] react
  - [x] react-router
  - [x] redux
  - [x] @loadable/component
    - [x] Comparison React.lazy and @loadalbe/component https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/loadable-components/docs/loadable-vs-react-lazy/
    - [x] ReactDOM.renderToString doesn't support React.lazy. So, we can not do SSR with React.lazy now.
    - [x] @loadable/component needs @loadable/babel-plugin. But it doesn't support typescript.
  - [x] styled-components
  - [x] react-intl
- Dev
  - [x] webpack
  - [x] typescript
  - [ ] eslint
  - [ ] prettier
- Features
  - [x] Server Side Rendering
  - [x] i18n
  - [ ] Hot Module Replacement

## TODO

- [ ] Use http.createServer
- [ ] Watch React.lazy on server side and loadable/component support typescript.
