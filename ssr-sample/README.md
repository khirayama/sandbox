## Stacks

- [x] express
- [x] react
- [x] react-router
- [ ] redux
- [x] @loadable/component
  - [x] Comparison React.lazy and @loadalbe/component https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/loadable-components/docs/loadable-vs-react-lazy/
  - [x] ReactDOM.renderToString doesn't support React.lazy. So, we can not do SSR with React.lazy now.
  - [x] @loadable/component needs @loadable/babel-plugin. But it doesn't support typescript.
- [ ] styled-components

- [x] webpack
- [x] typescript

- [x] Server Side Rendering
- [ ] i18n
- [ ] Hot Module Replacement

## TODO

- [ ] Use http.createServer
- [ ] Watch React.lazy on server side and loadable/component support typescript.
