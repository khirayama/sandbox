In addition to the TodoMVC and Chat examples, here are some more examples to help demonstrate how to use the Flux architectural pattern.

### NuclearMail

Facebook engineer Ian Obermiller shows how to build a more complex Flux application in [NuclearMail](https://github.com/ianobermiller/nuclearmail), an example GMail client. 

### Isomorphic Flux

"Isomorphic JavaScript" describes JS applications that run on both the client and the server. React can easily render HTML server-side, and here are some example and tools published by people using React and Flux in isomorphic applications.

[Yahoo! Flux examples](https://github.com/yahoo/flux-examples) by Michael Ridgway.  Michael provides a number of tools to build isomorphic Flux applications, including [Fluxible](https://github.com/yahoo/fluxible), [Dispatchr](https://github.com/yahoo/dispatchr), and [Routr](https://github.com/yahoo/routr).

[ssr-demo-kit](https://github.com/zertosh/ssr-demo-kit) by Andres Suarez.  In this example application, Andres shows how he has been building isomorphic Flux applications at SoundCloud.
