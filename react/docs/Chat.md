This example application was created for the [ForwardJS](http://forwardjs.com/) conference to show an
example of how a Flux app is structured, and how one can use
`Dispatcher.waitFor()` to make sure the callbacks that the stores register with
the dispatcher are called in the correct order.

The entire application is available in the React GitHub repo within the [flux-chat](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-chat/) example directory.
